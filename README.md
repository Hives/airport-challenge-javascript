The Airport Challenge.... but in JavaScript!!!

## Process

The idea was to write a program in a language we had little to no experience in. The Airport Challenge tests your ability to use basic OOP principles like encapsulation and SRP, TDD, stubbing random behaviour, writing readable code etc.

I recorded my process of doing in this in **a lot** of detail in [this document](all-the-gory-details.md) (warning - long-windedness!)
